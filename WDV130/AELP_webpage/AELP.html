<p>Today’s education system was built to standardize the way we teach and test. This worked well when most students would progress from school to an industrial job.

<p>Today’s education system was built to standardize the way we teach and test. This worked well when most students would progress from school to an industrial job. However, students are expected to perform more complex tasks in today’s workplace, when the current education system does not adequately prepare students for success in career and life. Given that each student has different learning needs at different times — we learn at different paces, have different aptitudes, and enter classes with different experiences and background knowledge — we need an education system that can offer customized instruction so that individual students can realize their full potential (Innosight Institute, A Guide to Personalized Learning, p.1).</p>
